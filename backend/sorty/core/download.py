"""Fetch an image URL to disk, refusing internal hosts and oversized bodies.

Sources return URLs we then fetch. Redirects are followed by hand so each hop's host is
checked before we connect, so a URL (or a redirect from one) can't reach localhost, a
cloud metadata endpoint, or an internal address. The body is streamed to a temp file and
capped, so a hostile or oversized response can't exhaust memory or leave a truncated
file the next run treats as done.
